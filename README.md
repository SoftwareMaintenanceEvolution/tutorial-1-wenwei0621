# Introduction 

Hi! I'm Chia Wen Wei, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I love watching YouTube in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software.
